# AirQualityAnalysis

Welcome to the **AirQualityAnalysis** repository! This repository contains the source code for the Streamlit app [bdb-airqualityanalysis](https://bdb-airqualityanalysis.streamlit.app). The app provides interactive visualizations and basic statistical analysis of pollutants in the AirQuality UCI dataset.

## Overview
The **AirQualityAnalysis** app is designed to help users explore and understand the levels of various pollutants over time using interactive charts and data insights. By leveraging Python libraries like `numpy` and `plotly`, the app offers a seamless experience for visual data analysis.

### Key Features

- **Statistical analysis**: Computes basic statistical summaries for different pollutants.
- **User-friendly interface**: Built using Streamlit for simplicity and accessibility.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Numpy**
- **Plotly**

## Dataset
The app uses the [AirQuality UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality), which contains hourly averaged responses of chemical sensors deployed in an Italian city. The dataset includes information on various pollutants such as CO, NOx and others, recorded over several months.
